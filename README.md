# react-proptypes-url-validator

Custom [PropType](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#prop-validation) that validates URLs. Depends on [url-regex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-regex).

### Why?

To warn if invalid URLs are passed down as props to React components. Particularly useful if your app has lots of external links, or if you're using React in a context with mixed server-side and client-side routing/rendering.
